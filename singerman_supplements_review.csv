The Order of Prayer for Divine Service is undated (only the original 1860 copyright date is given), whereas the surrounding sections in vol. 1, a composite volume as issued, are dated (see below). The section in vol. 1, Hymns, for Divine Service in the Temple Emanu-El, has imprint: N[ew] Y[ork]: M. Thalmessinger & Co., Stationers and Printers, and is copyright 1871. The Hymns section (German and English on facing pages) normally has 71, [1] p. (37 numbered hymns); the copy held by NRU, however, has 67 p. (33 numbered hymns). The Order of Prayer in the House of Mourners section (17 p.) has an 1869 imprint date; the AJHS copy, however, has the Order of Prayer in the House of Mourners section with 1871 as the imprint date. It remains to be determined whether or not this is an artificial set.

The Manual of Devotion for the House of Refuge, of the City of New York (New York, 1884) does not provide for a Catholic service; as a result, the Catholic Union of New York raised objections to this exclusion because the Christian chapel services are limited to Protestant children. Adler discusses the legitimate religious needs of the unserved Jewish children at the House of Refuge for juvenile delinquents located on Randall‚Äôs Island; their number is estimated to be between twenty and thirty (p. 9). He addresses some of the relevant separation of church and state issues and the question of whether or not the United States was founded, as many argue, as a Christian nation.

A Jew, it is true, can rise to be the premier of the British empire, but this is the exception noted; here there was contact with other people.

In the prophecies, the oppression and poverty of Israel are the especial marks of this indignation. Now, in almost all the countries of Christendom, the Jews are freed from oppression. And their era of poverty is past. The Jews are now the great capitalists of the world. They have attained an unprecedented prosperity, and are seemingly on the eve of centralizing all the industry of the earth in their hands.
